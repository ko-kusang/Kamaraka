# Kamaraka Project Timeline

Based on the assignment details provided, here’s a revised timeline with specific tasks and roles assigned to each group member, aligning with the requirements:

---

### **Week 1: Problem Scoping (Dec 9 – Dec 15)**
1. **Role 1: Team Lead**  
   - Assign roles and ensure everyone understands the assignment requirements.
   - Oversee problem selection and objective finalization.

2. **Role 2: Problem Analyst**  
   - Identify and document the real-life problem in detail (e.g., stock management challenges).
   - Draft a detailed problem statement and objectives.

3. **Role 3: Fuzzy Logic Planner**  
   - Outline potential inputs, outputs, and objectives for the fuzzy logic system.
   - Research Mamdani and Sugeno systems to determine which is more suitable.

4. **Role 4: Tool Researcher**  
   - Study the `skfuzzy` library in Python and share useful tutorials or resources with the team.
     -  scikit-fuzzy main library：`https://pythonhosted.org/scikit-fuzzy/api/api.html`
     -  Basic step to build up a fuzzy FrameWork
        -  Define Input and Output Variables->Define Membership Functions->Create the Fuzzy Control System->Input Data and Compute Output
   - Suggest coding structure and tools for the implementation.
     -   Suggesting Jupyter Notebook

---

### **Weeks 2–3: System Design and Data Preparation (Dec 16 – Dec 29)**

1. **Role 1: Team Lead**  
   - Regularly track progress and organize team discussions.
   - Assist in validating inputs, outputs, and fuzzification techniques.

2. **Role 2: Problem Analyst**  
   - Define the system’s inputs (e.g., "current stock levels") and outputs (e.g., "order quantity").
   - Collaborate with the Tool Researcher to identify appropriate datasets for testing.

3. **Role 3: Fuzzy Logic Planner**  
   - Design the knowledge base and fuzzy rule set (e.g., "IF stock is low AND demand is high THEN order large quantity").
   - Finalize fuzzification techniques and membership functions.

4. **Role 4: Tool Researcher**  
   - Assist in preparing and cleaning test datasets.
   - Set up Python environments and verify that `skfuzzy` works as expected.

### **Weeks 4–5: Implementation and Testing (Dec 30 – Jan 12)**

1. **Role 1: Team Lead**  
   - Organize weekly check-ins and ensure deadlines are met.
   - Document progress to assist with the final report.

2. **Role 2: Problem Analyst**  
   - Verify the implementation of fuzzy rules against the defined problem.
   - Ensure the system’s objectives are being met.

3. **Role 3: Fuzzy Logic Planner**  
   - Code the inference engine and perform defuzzification.
   - Debug issues and optimize rule sets for accuracy.

4. **Role 4: Tool Researcher**  
   - Conduct test runs with various inputs.
   - Analyze and record system behavior for inclusion in the report.

---

### **Final Week: Presentation and Report (Jan 13 – Jan 15)**

1. **Role 1: Team Lead**  
   - Compile all parts of the report (problem, objectives, system design, and results).
   - Ensure report formatting and submission guidelines are followed.

2. **Role 2: Problem Analyst**  
   - Record the presentation section on problem description and objectives.
   - Assist in preparing slides or visuals.

3. **Role 3: Fuzzy Logic Planner**  
   - Record the technical demonstration of the system, focusing on rules and system design.
   - Provide test results for the presentation.

4. **Role 4: Tool Researcher**  
   - Ensure the Python implementation is packaged correctly for submission.
   - Edit the presentation video and confirm it meets the 15-minute requirement.
